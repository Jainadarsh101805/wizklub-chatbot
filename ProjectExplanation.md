# WizKlub Chatbot Prototype - Submission Details

## 🚀 Live Demo Link
The localized prototype is running at:
👉 **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## 📋 Project Overview
This chatbot is designed to maximize conversion for WizKlub by segmenting the two primary audiences (Parents and Schools) and providing value before asking for contact details.

### 1. Unified Audience Segmentation
The bot immediately identifies if the visitor is a **Parent** or a **School Representative**. This ensures we don't treat a potential B2B partner as a retail lead.

### 2. High-Conversion Flow (True Conversational)
To minimize friction, the bot now:
1.  **Welcome & Identify**: Immediate greeting followed by user type selection.
2.  **Sequential Collection**: Instead of a daunting form, it asks for **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone** one by one in the chat stream.
3.  **Qualification**: After relationship building, it initiates the STEM Quiz or Needs Assessment.
4.  **Closing**: Confirms the booking with personalized feedback.

### 3. Lead Capture & Automation
The bot captures the following mandatory data points:
1.  **Name**
2.  **Phone Number**
3.  **Email Address**
4.  **User Type** (Parent / School)
5.  **Organization** (For Schools)

### 4. The "Antigravity" Ultra-Premium Strategy
To ensure this prototype stands out, I have implemented an **Ultra-Premium Feature Set**:
1.  **Antigravity Particle Cloud**: A high-fidelity particle swarm that trails the cursor with spatial physics.
2.  **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: A persistent progress bar at the top of the interface gamifies the lead generation process.
3.  **Dynamic Mesh Surface**: An animated mesh gradient background that flows between brand colors.
4.  **Conversion Redirection**: The final "Book a Demo" button is directly integrated with [wizklub.com](https://wizklub.com).
5.  **Adarsh Persona**: A trust-building AI persona with typing simulations and confetti rewards.

## 📈 Key Metrics to Track
1.  **Flow-Through Rate**: % of users who start the quiz and reach the lead form.
2.  **Conversion by Segment**: Tracking which audience type (Parent vs School) has a higher booking rate.
3.  **Engagement Depth**: Average number of messages exchanged before conversion.
